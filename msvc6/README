This is the directory you come to to compile log4c on windows.

Versions of the Compiler and Windows we tested with
===================================================

This compile has been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio for C/C++ version 6
on Windows XP Home and Professional Editions.

Note that the compilation using the cygwin environment to generate the dll with gcc
worked very smoothly on Windows (both with and without the --no-cygwin option).

However our goal was to port log4c to the native Windows compiler--this is mostly a commercial
driver, common practice in industry being to 'go native' on any given platform.

Level of Support on Windows
===========================

Some Unix specific appenders like syslog and mmap are naturally not ported to Windows.
The dated_r layout is not currently ported (but could be).

With the above caveat, all the tests and examples run fine on Windows.

xxx Currently two of the tests in the test_rc test are failing.

How to compile log4c on Windows
===============================

You will need an environment like the free cygwin or Windows Services for Unix from Microsoft.

It would certainly be possible to adjust the Makefile so that one could use the
Microsoft nmake program and run the compile in a DOS box....but log4c coming from
the Unix world, it just seemed more natural to go this way.

So, go to the unix emulation shell prompt.  You will need the Microsoft Visual Studio
stuff on your path.  When you install it, it creates a batch file you 
can run to set up your environment appropriately. Type 'make'.

The .dll and .lib will be compiled into the ./log4c/log4c directory and the test
programs into ./log4c/tests, the examples into log4c/examples.

To run a test program type './gotest.sh test_stream2', for example.  To
see the outputs from the test program go down into the log4c/tests subdirectory.

Overview of the porting effort of log4c to Windows
==================================================

It seems that the latest versions of the Microsoft comiler provide more 
compatibility with Unix...but as version 6 is widely deployed we decided to 
port with that as our reference.

I think there are three main areas to look at: build environment, code changes and
packaging.

1. Build Environment
--------------------

cygwin works very well indeed as a Unix shell emulator and the cygwin online installer is 
amazing--it allows you to select what you need to download...and then go back later
to uninstall or install more.  And it just works.

I tried hard to integrate this compile on Windows into the automake tools
but they just don't work at the time of writing (Dec 2005).  Please refer to the automake
mail archive and search for 'microsoft' or 'msvc' to find information.  It seems
there are patches available...but when they wil be integrated is not clear.

So, we have a seperate Makefile :-( which will need to be synced seperately with changes or
additions to the workspace.  In addition we have a hardcoded version.h file.  On Unix
this is auto generated from version.in.  Apart from that nothing tricky here.

Some useful build tools from cygwin:
make, nm

Some useful build tools from Microsoft:
. depends.exe (ldd alike), dumpbin.exe (nm alike)
. msdev.exe <program name> (to start the debugger with MSVC6)
. With Visual Studio C++ 2005 Express Edition (it's free!) to start the
  debugger: vcexpress.exe /debugexe <program name>
. For debugging, the key compiler option is /Zi and for the linker, /DEBUG.

2. Code Changes
---------------

You will see '#ifdef _WIN32' type lines in the code.  We tried to factor
as much as we could into the ./src/sd/sd_xplatform.c and sd/sd_xplatform.h files.

There are a few common functions like sprintf and strcasecmp that are slightly
different on windows (the function name is prefixed with '_' on Windows).  You can see the full
list of such functions we needed to patch in the ./src/sd/sd_xplatform.h file.

Another irritating point is that msvc6 does not support variable argument
macros...we handle that by defining the sd_debug() macros to be functions
on Windows, where variable numbers of arguments are supported.

The inline directive on Windows is either __inline or __forceinline.  See the Mincrosoft
language reference for Visual C++ 6.0 for details on how they work.  You will see some points
in the code, for example in category.h where on Windows we redefine an inline the function
as a macro.  This is not really required as we could just redefine inline to be __inline
in sd_xplatform.h.

The getopt style function does not exist on Windows, so we implemented one ourselves.

Fortunately log4c does not right now create threads of it's own...so we did
not have to deal with that. However, in the future to get xplatform mutexes etc.
we will need to think about that. 

An important point for windows is that your dll must export it's symbols.
There are three ways to do this: use /EXPORT on the command line of link.exe, use a .def file
or use the 'declspec' directives.  We use the latter technique in order to have the 
exported nature of the function defined at the same place as the function...logical, no ?
This is the purpose of the LOG4C_API macro--when we compile log4c it is defined
so that the functions are exported, but when an application links to the log4c dll,
it is changed to import.  See the src/log4c/config-win32.h file for those
definitions.

3. Packaging
------------- 

To do: what would the native windows packaging for a dll look like ?

In the interim, we will just bundle the windows deliverables into the tarball.

  a hugely valuable resource for ideas on solving issues like porting.  In particular
  the Mozilla NSPR, LDAP SDK for example are similar to log4c in that they furnish a

  their make files.  Log4C++ come to that!
