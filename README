This is the distribution of Log4C

* What is Log4C

   Log4C is a library of C for flexible logging to files, syslog and other
   destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as is
   reasonable.

* Licensing

   Log4C libraries are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (GNU LGPL). 

   You can find copies of the license in the file COPYING

* What you will need

   gcc3

   you will also need the bison-1.35 and flex-2.5.27 to re generate
   the xml parser. These are obsolete versions of bison and
   flex. Therefore, pre-generated files are distributed in the tarball. 

* Where to find ...

   gcc3		http://gcc.gnu.org

   log4c	http://log4c.sf.net/
		
   bison	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison

   flex		http://sourceforge.net/projects/lex/

   The SourceForge site is now the main log4c site.

* How to ...

   The log4c package uses the GNU autotools compilation and installation
   framework. The following commands should build log4c on the supported
   platforms:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/path/of/installation
	$ make
	$ make install

   Have Fun !!
