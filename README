This is the distribution of Log4C


* What is Log4C

   Log4C is a C library for flexible logging to files, syslog and other
   destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library
   (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to their API as is
   reasonable.

* Licensing

   Log4C libraries are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (GNU LGPL). 

   You can find copies of the license in the file COPYING

* What you will need to compile Log4C on Unix systems

   perl 5.8+ (used by the automake tools)

   GNU make tools: automake 1.7+, autoconf 2.57+, m4 1.4+ and libtool 1.4+

   A Compiler, among those tested are:
   . gcc3 (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4)
   . gcc4 (on HP-UX 11.11i, on Fedora Core 5)
   . Sun cc (versions 5.3 and 5.7 on Solaris 8 and higher, sparc and i386)
   . HPUX ansi C compiler (on HPUX v11.11i, pa-risc)

   If you request at compile time that the expat library be used to help parse
   the configuration file, then you will need the expat library available
   on the system.  If you do not use expat then pre-generated files from
   obsolete versions of flex and bison are used to do the parsing--this code
   is still supported for the moment but it is recommended to use expat.

* For information on compiling on Microsoft Windows see the README in the msvc6 directory.

* Where to find ...

   GNU automake tools:
	     	http://gcc.gnu.org
              	http://www.sunfreeware.com/ for pre-built Solaris packages
                http://hpux.connect.org.uk/ for re-built HP-UX depots

   gcc3		http://gcc.gnu.org
              	http://www.sunfreeware.com for pre-built Solaris packages
                http://hpux.connect.org.uk/ for re-built HP-UX depots

                This SourceForge site is now the main log4c site.

* How to for library users ...

   The log4c package uses the GNU autotools compilation and installation
   framework. The following commands should build log4c on the supported
   platforms:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/path/of/installation
	$ make
	$ make install

   To build the binary, source, developer and debuginfo RPMs for Linux:
        make rpm

   To enable compilation of the test programs for the library you would do this:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test
   
   To specify a compiler other than gcc you would do something like this:
       $ ./configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test CC=/usr/SUNWspro/bin/cc

   To get started with the examples see the README in the examples source code directory:
       cd examples
       ./application_1
       ./application_2

* How to for library developers ...
   
   When you check out log4c you will need to generate the configure script and so on.  To do this
   run the bootstrap script:
	$ ./bootstrap

   To compile in extra tracing and messages you would do this:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/path/of/installation --enable-test --enable-debug

   This will define the __SD_DEBUG__ variable at compile time.  Note that you still
   need to define the SD_ERROR and SD_DEBUG envronment variables at run time
   to get the error/debug output.

   See './configure --help' for a list of all the configure options. Some of the options are
   generic autoconf options, while the Log4c specific options are prefixed with 
   "LOG4C" in the help text.


Have Fun !!
